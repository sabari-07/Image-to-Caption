Introduction
The image-to-caption generator creates textual descriptions for images using a combination of the Xception model (for image feature extraction) and an LSTM-based network (for generating captions). This model is trained on a dataset of images paired with corresponding captions.

Dependencies
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

numpy
matplotlib
Pillow (PIL)
tensorflow (including keras)
nltk
tqdm
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy matplotlib pillow tensorflow nltk tqdm
Usage
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sabari-07/image-to-caption-generator.git
cd image-to-caption-generator
Prepare the Data

Make sure your dataset is organized as specified in the project. Typically, this involves having images and their corresponding captions in a structured format.

Preprocess Data

Use the provided scripts or functions to preprocess the images and captions. This step involves tokenizing captions, converting images to feature vectors, and preparing sequences for training.

Train the Model

Execute the training script to train the model on your dataset. Ensure that you adjust hyperparameters and paths to match your setup.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Generate Captions

Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate captions for new images. Use the provided inference script or functions to test the model.

bash
Copy code
python generate_captions.py --image_path path/to/your/image.jpg
Model Architecture
Image Feature Extraction: Uses the Xception model pre-trained on ImageNet to extract feature vectors from images.
Caption Generation: Employs an LSTM-based sequence model to generate captions based on the extracted image features.
Attention Mechanism: Incorporates attention mechanisms to improve caption quality by focusing on different parts of the image during caption generation.
Evaluation
The model's performance can be evaluated using BLEU scores, which measure the quality of generated captions against reference captions. The nltk library is used for BLEU score computation.

To evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py --dataset path/to/evaluation/dataset
